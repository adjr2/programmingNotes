## Cloud Computing

### Week 1

#### Introduction to Cloud Computing

Why Cloud Computing:

- Flexibility and Scalability: better than local hosting of the server.
- A business model with the latest trends: no need of costly update to the IT infrastructure.
- Availability: can be accessed from anywhere.

Definition: a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Example of computing resources: networks, servers, storage, application, and services.

This Cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, four deployment models and three service models.

Five essential characteristics of the Cloud: on-demand self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.

On demand self-service, the first characteristic, means you can access Cloud resources whenever required.
Broad network access means that Cloud computing resources can be accessed through the network.
With resource pooling, consumers save on costs when using a shared model. This model provides Cloud providers economies of scale.
Rapid elasticity implies that you can increase or decrease resources as per your demand.
Measured service means that you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go.

##### History

The concept of cloud computing dates to the 1950s when large-scale mainframes with high-volume processing power became available. The practice of time sharing (or resource pooling) evolved to make efficient use of the computing power of mainframes. Using dumb terminals, whose sole purpose was facilitating access to the mainframes, multiple users could access the same data storage layer and CPU power from any terminal. In the 1970s, with the release of an operating system called Virtual Machine (VM), it became possible for mainframes to have multiple virtual systems, or virtual machines, on a single physical node. Each virtual machine hosted guest operating systems that behaved like they had their own memory, CPU, and hard drives, even though these were shared resources. Virtualization thus became a technological driver and a massive catalyst for some of the most significant evolutions in communications and computing.

A hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources. A hypervisor also separates the Virtual Machines logically, assigning each slice of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage, preventing the virtual machines from interfering with each other.

Users could now order cloud resources from a larger pool of available resources and pay for them on a per-use basis, also known as pay-as-you-go. This pay-as-you-go or utility computing model, became one of the key drivers behind cloud computing's launching. This allowed them to switch to a more cash-flow friendly OpEx model from a CapEx model.

Agility, flexibility, and competitiveness are key drivers for moving to the cloud, provided it is done without creating business disruption or issues related to security, compliance and performance.

##### In this lesson, you have learned:

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.

The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.

Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.

#### Business case for Cloud Computing

##### In this lesson, you have learned:

The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are asking not whether they should move to the cloud but rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.

#### Emerging Technologies Accelerated by Cloud

The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a giant network of connected things and people that have changed much of how we live our daily lives - from the way we drive, to how we make purchases, monitoring our personal health, and even how we get energy for our homes. Smart devices and sensors are continuously tracking and collecting data.

There is a three-way relationship between AI, IoT, and Cloud. Just as AI consumes the data produced by IoT devices, the IoT device's behavior can be dictated based on responses from AI. For example, smart assistants. A common type of IoT device continues to learn about the user's preferences as usage grows. Such as songs they like, their home temperature settings, preferred mealtimes, and over time they anticipate their actions based on the user's past history. What we see is a symbiotic relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud. IoT delivers the data, AI powers the insights, and both these emerging technologies leverage Cloud scalability and processing power to provide value to individuals and businesses alike.

Blockchain is a secure distributed open technology that can help speed up processes, lower costs, and build transparency and traceability in transactional applications. It is an immutable network allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant to them. The more open, diverse, and distributed the network, the stronger the trust and transparency in the data and transactions. Blockchain and AI, much like IoT and AI powered by the Cloud, also have a three-way relationship. Where blockchain technology provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI powers the analytics and decision-making from the data collected, and Cloud provides globally distributed, scalable and cost efficient computing resources to support both the unprecedented amounts of data being collected and the processing power required to draw insights from this data.

Analytics technologies on the Cloud leverage the flexibility, scalability, and computing resources available on the Cloud. From tracking trends on social media to predict future events, to analyzing data to build machine learning models that can be deployed in cognitive applications. Cloud provides the integrated environment that is required to leverage data for continuous improvement and accelerated business growth.

Emerging technologies powered by the cloud are disrupting existing business models and creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses to grow, innovate, and create value for their customers.
